🧾 Overview
Customer churn is a major concern for subscription-based businesses and service providers. Predicting churn ahead of time allows organizations to proactively engage with at-risk customers. In this project, we preprocess the dataset, perform feature engineering, train multiple machine learning models, and evaluate their performance to identify the most accurate predictor of churn.

❓ Problem Statement
To develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will churn (i.e., leave the service), based on various customer demographic, account, and usage attributes.

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data wrangling

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
